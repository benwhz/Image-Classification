# Image Classification

Image classification on the MNIST dataset using different models.

- Dataset: MINST (https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
- 4 Models:
    - Convolutional Neural Network (3 convolution layers + max pooling layers)
    - Recurrent Neural Network (with keras SimpleRNN layer)
    - Multilayer Perceptron (A sequential model consisting of three fully connected layers)
    - Transformer-Encoder (Using transformer encoder as feature extractor)
- with Keras 3 API

The codes runs on Python 3.11.8 and requires the following packages:

- numpy 1.23.5
- keras 3.5.0
- matplotlib 3.7.2

> Keras Backend supports: 'jax', 'tensorflow' and 'torch'.
